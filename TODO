TODO (ideas) :
**************

- Get rid of functions returning their results through shared variables
- Call variables using the cleaner ${} syntax
- Improve ldapid/ldapgid to dump the whole directory if no argument is given
- Make the runtime file useable as a shell library : avoid exit in end_* functions
- Send ldap clients error logs to stdout as well as to logfile
- Allow use of DNs (instead of short names) as command arguments
- Make some scripts useable with lower privileges than root :
  - Move ldapid, ldapfinger, ldapsetpasswd, lsldap to bin/ and set them suid
  - Allow common users to use these tools. It will require a kind of privilege separation
    not to bypass OpenLDAP ACLs (binding with user's account id necessary).
  - Ldapsetpasswd without any argument should change the caller's passwd if logname != root
- Check for base (mandatory) binaries at install time (new 'test' target => sed, grep, ...)
  Better testing on configured/additional binaries at run time (e.g. add -f for each -x test)
- Allow to use %g (goup name) in ldapadduser (for _HOMEDIR and _genpassword)
- Add more options to the scripts (a better parsing will be necessary)
  - an option to ldapdeleteuser to delete users' home directories
  - a 'dry-run' option to display (only) LDIF data
  - an option to modify the home dirs (LDAP + directory + rights) of a user when renaming it ?
  - an option to modify related groups (memberUid's) when renaming/deleting a user/machine ?
  - an option to block deleting a group if it is a user's primary group ?
